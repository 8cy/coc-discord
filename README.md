# coc-discord
an improved discord rich presence for coc.nvim

# Usage
1. For the time being, this isn't an official [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) plugin. So please download it from the [releases](https://github.com/8cy/coc-discord/releases/latest).
2. Run `$ yarn` or `$ npm i` to install all the dependencies.
3. Run `$ yarn build` or `$ npm run build` to build the plugin.
4. Move the `lib/` directory to your coc plugins directory. (On Windows, this is usually `C:\Users\${User}\AppData\Local\coc\extensions\node_modules`).

## What is this?
This is just a simple fork of [coc-discord](https://github.com/amiralies/coc-discord) with some added extra features.

## New features
- **.prettierrc.yml** üé± 
    1. Change `tabwidth` to 4 instead of 2 spaces.
- **package.json** üëç 
    1. Make `clean` npm script use [rimraf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rimraf) instead of `$ rm -rf` for multi-platform compatibility.
    2. Remove lint function from `prepack` npm script.
- **src/index.ts** ‚ô®Ô∏è 
    1. Change line ending format from CRLF to LF, *don't remember, might be vice versa lol*.
    2. Change file indentation from 2 space to 1, 4 space tab.
    3. Change `clientId` to valid one for project.
    4. Change change `state` value in `setActivity` from `workspace.root` to `workspace.workspaceFolder.name` so the Discord rich presence doesn't show the whole path, just the folder's name.
    5. Change `state` value in `setActivity` from *"On:"* to *"Workspace:"*.
    6. Add a large image to activity.
    7. Add large image hover text for the large image.

## TODO
- [ ] Language independent activity small images. *Sort of like this;*
